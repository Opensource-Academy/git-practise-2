Git practise project 2

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the first git tutorial.

## Solo learners

Like before, make a fork of the project, then fork from your fork and clone the last one to your machine.

This project contains more than one branch.

Change to the other branch and see what happens!

Once you have found the other branch, make your own branch and switch to it.

Once you are in your own branch, add a file. (If you have no instpiration, see below).

Push your new branch to GitHub.

Create a pull request asking yourself to merge your new branch into the first fork.

## For learners in pairs or with a teacher

Like before, create forks of the project and then create forks from the other person's fork. Clone the latter to your machines.

This project contains more than one branch.

Change to the other branch and see what happens!

Once you have found the other branch, make your own branch and switch to it.

Once you are in your own branch, add a file. (If you have no instpiration, see below).

Push your new branch to GitHub.

Create a pull request asking the other person to merge your new branch into their first fork.

For 3 learners

Like before, do the same as described above for duos, but work from person A to B, person B to C and person C to A.

## Inspiration

If you do not know what to put into your file, you could go with:

```
for word in ['Branching', 'is', 'not', 'complicated']:
    print(word)
```

Make sure you save this file as a `.py` file (for example `branches.py`), so others will know that it is a python script.
